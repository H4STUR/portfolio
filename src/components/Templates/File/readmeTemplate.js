const NotesTemplate = 
`Welcome to my portfolio!

🖥️ This interactive desktop was crafted with love to mimic the nostalgic look and feel of Windows XP. 
Click around, open folders, run apps — have fun!

💻 Built with:
- React (Frontend)
- Laravel (API for Minesweeper scores and contact form)
- React DnD (Drag & Drop desktop icons)
- Custom styled components for Windows XP aesthetics

🎮 Projects:
Some folders contain projects built in Unity, game logic, and other experiments. Double-click icons to open them, just like you would on a real desktop.

📩 Contact:
Use the built-in Email app to send me a message — it hooks into a real Laravel-powered backend.

🎯 Tip:
Try commands like \`help\`, \`dir\`, \`cd\`, and \`type README.txt\` in the terminal for a true retro coding vibe.

Enjoy exploring!
